# csTimerAnalyst
csTimerAnalyst is a simple tool, which gives you lots of interesting data about your solves. It tells information like your total mean and total time spent. It also has the option to show graphs of how you did over time or how many solves you did per day.

# Installation
Before you start using this app you have to have a [Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. You also need matplotlib and pandas libraries, which can be installed by running `pip install matplotlib` and `pip install pandas` in cmd. 

# Usage
You can either run `commandLine.py` or `gui.py`. Both will prompt you to load your session .csv file and give you some basic data. Currently only the CLI version allows graph customisation.
