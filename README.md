# csTimerAnalyst
csTimerAnalyst is a simple tool, which gives you lots of interesting data about your solves. It tells information like your total mean and total time spent, but it also has the option to show graphs of how you did over time or showing how many solves you did per day.

# Installation
Before you start using this app you have to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install `matplotlib` and `pandas`.

# Usage
Run the `commandLine.py` script. It will prompt you to give your .csv file's path. After that you have access to a simple cli, which allows you to get more data about your session.
