# csTimerAnalyst
csTimerAnalyst is a simple tool, which gives you lots of interesting data about your solves. It tells information like your total mean and total time spent, but it also has the option to show graphs of how you did over time or showing how many solves you did per day.

# Installation
Before you start using this app you have to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install `matplotlib` and `pandas`.

# Usage
You can either run `commandLine.py` or `gui.py`. Both will prompt you to load your session .csv file and give you some basic data. Currently only the CLI version allows graph customisation.
